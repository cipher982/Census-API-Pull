## Census API Pull via Python
### David Rose

This code can be used to pull in various census information through an API and collect it all to a CSV file. Currently is setup to pull county level information through a specific state (Alabama) and the various age/gender brackets for each county.

Code can be modified to various geographical heierarchies as needed.
